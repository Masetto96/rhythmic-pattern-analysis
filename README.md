# rythmic-pattern-analysis
## internship @ music technology group

#### The steps to carry out for this project are:
- Implement some rhythm descriptors (that will be integrated into Essentia).
- Compare existing rhythm descriptors for the task of rhythm pattern recognition.
- Ideally, propose improvements for the deep learning approach to reach the state of the art.

**computation_demo.ipynb:**  
   Illustrates how different parameters impact the computation of the scale transform magnitude (STM). It provides an overview of all the necessary steps involved in the computation.

**transformation_demo.ipynb:**  
   Evaluates the degree to which the feature maintains its invariance despite transformations applied to the signal.

**classification_demo.ipynb:**  
   Showcases the practical application of the feature for classification purposes utilizing the ballroom and greek dances dataset.

**stm.py:**  
  Contains the implementation of the magnitude scale transformation and all the necessary functions to compute it.
